To run these scripts, begin with the "TQ_AC_data.csv" file sent to you via email, and the helpseeking_counter.py file.
Put them in the same folder for ease-of-use, then run the python file. This should create the "counted.csv" file,
which was also sent to you via email.

Next, use the "counted.csv" file and the "demographics_information" file (also sent to you via email), and put them in
the same folder as the "demographics_associator.py" file. You will need to include the "test1.csv" and "test2.csv" files in 
this folder as well for things to run properly. Run the python file. This should create the "test.csv" which was my practice
dataframe, as well as the "combined.csv", the final file for this project.
